* Get access to (all) guides, tutorials and explanations from the Wiki
* Get access to All-in-One Config from any Arma game (seperate download to reduce filesize)
* "Favorites" to save and quickly access your favorite content

## Todo's
* Implement additional database downloads (like AiO). [project](https://github.com/evanlucas/remote-file-size)
* Implement Google Analytics for application tracking. MUST be disabled by default! [project](https://github.com/vacu/electron-google-analytics)
* Implement auto-updater. [info](https://www.electron.build/auto-update)
* Add MacOS and Linux version

## Known Issues
* Content might not have the correct markup, missing information or is broken in multiple ways. This is due to the fact that the wiki markup is inconsistent and hard to transfer to JSON.
* Not all features are implemented yet. **ArmaDoc is currently an early WIP.**
